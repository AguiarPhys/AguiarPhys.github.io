Welcome to my page! :wave:

I am a Phd Student in Atom Optics working in the [Optics Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/research/groups/optics/) under the supervision of Prof Sonja Franke-Arnold. 

We are interested in the study of atom-light interactions with structured light through atomic rubidium vapour to explore applications in high-precision magnetic and inertial sensing. This work 

My research interests include cold atom trapping and sensing, BECs, and atom interferometry.

Previously I completed my Master's degree in Physics with specialisation in Quantum Optics at the University of Strathclyde, where I was advised by Dr Aidan Arnold.

I am currently the Vice-President of the [Glasgow Optical Society](https://opticalsoc.github.io/), and an organising member of the Scottish Conference in Optical Technologies (SCOT). 

Thank you for stopping by!
